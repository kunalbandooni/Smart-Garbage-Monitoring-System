# Smart-Garbage-Monitoring-System
___
## 1.0 About Project : 

- This project just needs a power supply through a simple micro type mobile charger and a Wi-Fi Connection.
- The system makes use of NodeMCU, Servo Motor and IR sensors. 
- It provides Smart City real time working of Garbage Monitoring System. 
- This project is connected to Blynk App through which user is notified about the dustbin being nearly full. 
- The project notifies as a notification and an E-Mail, if dustbin is about to fill.
